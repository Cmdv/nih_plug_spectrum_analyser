# High-performance spectrum analyzer crates for nih_plug audio plugins

Implementing a professional spectrum analyzer for VST/CLAP plugins in Rust requires careful selection of FFT libraries, DSP utilities, and visualization frameworks. Based on comprehensive research, **phastft** delivers the fastest FFT performance (681ns for 128 samples) with minimal memory overhead, though it requires nightly Rust. For stable Rust projects, **realfft v3.5.0** provides optimal real-valued FFT processing at approximately 50% faster speeds than complex FFTs, while the **spectrum-analyzer** crate offers a complete, production-ready solution with built-in window functions and no_std compatibility.

## FFT crates benchmarked for real-time audio

The FFT library choice fundamentally impacts spectrum analyzer performance, with several mature options available for different use cases.

### Performance leaders by buffer size and stability

According to [comprehensive FFT benchmarks](https://github.com/astral4/fft-benchmark), **phastft** dominates performance benchmarks with **681.9ns for 128-sample FFTs** and only 992 bytes of memory allocation, representing a 38% speed improvement over RustFFT. However, it requires nightly Rust due to portable SIMD dependencies and only supports power-of-2 sizes. For production stability, [**RustFFT v6.4.0**](https://crates.io/crates/rustfft) (actively maintained, updated monthly) provides excellent performance with automatic SIMD detection for AVX, SSE4.1, and NEON architectures, processing 512-sample buffers in 3.915μs with 21.7KB memory usage.

[**RealFFT v3.5.0**](https://crates.io/crates/realfft) wraps RustFFT specifically for real-valued audio signals, exploiting Hermitian symmetry to achieve approximately **2x speedup** over complex FFTs. This makes it ideal for spectrum analyzers where input is always real audio data. The library maintains the same SIMD acceleration as RustFFT while halving the computational complexity.

For embedded or low-latency applications, [**microfft v0.6.0**](https://lib.rs/crates/microfft) offers no_std compatibility with in-place processing and pre-computed twiddle factor tables. Though limited to power-of-2 sizes up to 32768 points, it achieves consistent sub-microsecond performance for small buffers with only 1KB of read-only tables for 128-sample FFTs.

### Integration with nih_plug architecture

[NIH-plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug) provides **"bring-your-own-FFT" adapters** with built-in STFT helpers for overlap-add processing. The framework's compositional Buffer interfaces integrate seamlessly with any FFT library through pre-allocated planners initialized during plugin startup. The **stft example plugin** demonstrates proper buffer management with overlap factors, showing how to maintain real-time safety while processing spectral data.

## DSP and window function utilities

Comprehensive DSP processing requires window functions, filtering capabilities, and spectral analysis utilities beyond basic FFT operations.

### Window functions and spectral processing

The [**spectrum-analyzer v1.1.0**](https://crates.io/crates/spectrum-analyzer) crate provides a complete solution with Hann, Hamming, and Blackman-Harris window functions, achieving **90μs processing time for 4096 samples** using microfft-real backend. Its no_std compatibility (MSRV 1.81.0) makes it suitable for embedded real-time systems while providing educational documentation and [live visualization examples](https://github.com/phip1611/spectrum-analyzer).

For specialized window requirements, [**apodize**](https://github.com/snd/apodize) offers iterator-based implementations of Hanning, Hamming, Blackman, Nuttall, and generalized cosine windows with minimal allocation overhead. The [**hann-rs**](https://github.com/F0rty-Tw0/hann-rs) crate provides blazingly fast Hann windows through pre-computed lookup tables for common sizes (256-4096 samples).

### Zero-allocation DSP ecosystems

The [**dasp v0.11.0**](https://github.com/RustAudio/dasp) ecosystem delivers comprehensive PCM DSP fundamentals with strict zero-allocation design principles. Its modular architecture includes dasp-envelope for RMS/peak detection, dasp-signal for processing chains, and dasp-ring-buffer for fixed-size circular buffers. With over 341K downloads and no_std compatibility, it's proven in production audio applications.

[**fundsp v0.20.0**](https://github.com/SamiPerttu/fundsp) offers composable graph notation for complex signal processing networks, enabling expressions like `sine_hz(440.0) >> lowpass_hz(1000.0, 1.0)` with stack-allocated, zero-cost abstractions. Its three prelude environments (generic, 64-bit, 32-bit) support different precision requirements while maintaining real-time safety.

## Visualization and rendering frameworks

Spectrum analyzer displays require high-performance graphics capable of 60+ FPS updates within plugin host environments.

### GUI framework compatibility matrix

**egui** integration via [**nih_plug_egui**](https://nih-plug.robbertvanderhelm.nl/nih_plug_egui/index.html) provides the fastest development path with immediate-mode rendering achieving consistent 60+ FPS. Its lightweight memory footprint and OpenGL backend make it ideal for rapid prototyping, as demonstrated in the gain_gui_egui example with integrated peak meters.

**VIZIA** (via [nih_plug_vizia](https://nih-plug.robbertvanderhelm.nl/nih_plug_vizia/index.html)) offers superior visual polish with femtovg-based OpenGL rendering and reactive state management. While requiring more setup than egui, it provides CSS-like styling and audio-specific UI patterns proven in production plugins. The framework excels at complex visualizations with efficient GPU acceleration.

For maximum performance, **wgpu** direct integration enables custom shader-based rendering with Vulkan/Metal/DX12 support. The byo_gui_wgpu example demonstrates embedding custom graphics pipelines, achieving optimal performance for complex spectral visualizations at the cost of implementation complexity.

### Plotting and spectrum display

[**plotters v0.3.x**](https://github.com/plotters-rs/plotters) provides high-performance plotting with multiple backends including wgpu for GPU acceleration. Its support for line series, area charts, and histograms maps directly to spectrum analyzer requirements, with proven use in the [audio-visualizer](https://phip1611.de/blog/live-audio-visualization-with-rust-in-a-gui-window/) crate for real-time spectral displays.

[**femtovg**](https://github.com/femtovg/femtovg) delivers a Canvas-style API similar to HTML5, making it intuitive for spectrum rendering with anti-aliased paths, gradients, and text. At only 395KB binary size with 34K+ monthly downloads, it provides an excellent balance of features and performance for plugin GUIs.

## Existing implementations and architecture patterns

Production plugins demonstrate proven architectural patterns for spectrum analyzer integration.

### Reference implementations in nih_plug

The [**Spectral Compressor plugin**](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/tree/master/plugins/spectral_compressor) showcases advanced FFT processing with 16,384 frequency bands, implementing frequency-domain compression with sidechain spectral matching. Its architecture demonstrates proper thread communication using `Arc<Mutex<Vec<f32>>>` for sharing spectrum data between audio and GUI threads.

[**Diopser**](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/blob/master/plugins/diopser/src/lib.rs) implements SIMD-optimized filtering with integrated spectrum display, utilizing `std::simd::f32x2` for portable SIMD operations. The plugin exemplifies real-time safe spectrum visualization with lock-free data structures and atomic updates.

### Thread-safe data sharing patterns

Three primary patterns emerge for audio-to-GUI communication: **atomic buffers** using `Arc<AtomicCell<Vec<f32>>>` for simple updates, **lock-free ring buffers** via [crossbeam's](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam) SegQueue for high-frequency streaming, and **mutex-protected buffers** for lower-frequency batch updates. The choice depends on update frequency and latency requirements, with lock-free structures preferred for sub-millisecond update intervals.

## SIMD optimization strategies

Modern processors achieve 4-8x speedups through SIMD instructions, now accessible via stable Rust.

### Stable SIMD with std::simd

Since Rust 1.80, [**std::simd**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/simd/index.html) provides portable SIMD abstractions with automatic instruction set detection. Vector types like `f32x4`, `f32x8`, and `f32x16` compile to SSE2, AVX, AVX2, or NEON instructions based on target architecture. [RustFFT's SIMD architecture analysis](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/exploring-rustffts-simd-architecture/53780) reveals that AVX's 12xn algorithm achieves optimal register utilization, with 40-50% of computation time spent on transpose operations.

[**simdeez**](https://lib.rs/crates/simdeez) offers runtime CPU feature detection with fallbacks from AVX2 → SSE4.1 → SSE2 → scalar, ensuring optimal performance across diverse hardware. Its `simd_runtime_generate!` macro automatically generates optimized code paths for each instruction set.

### Parallel FFT processing

[**rayon**](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) enables data-parallel processing of FFT bins with its work-stealing scheduler and "potential parallelism" model. Converting `.iter()` to `.par_iter()` parallelizes frequency band processing, filter banks, and spectral analysis operations. For finer control, [**crossbeam**](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam) provides lock-free data structures and scoped threads suitable for real-time audio pipelines.

## Audio measurement and utility crates

Professional spectrum analyzers require calibrated measurements and specialized audio utilities.

### Decibel conversions and scaling

The [**decibel**](https://lib.rs/crates/decibel) crate provides type-safe amplitude-to-dB conversions with `AmplitudeRatio` and `DecibelRatio` types, ensuring -6.02 dBFS calculations for half-amplitude signals. For GUI integration, [**iced_audio**](https://lib.rs/crates/iced_audio) offers `LogDBRange` for logarithmic dB controls, while [**surge-tables**](https://lib.rs/crates/surge-tables) provides pre-computed lookup tables using the formula `linear_gain = 10^(0.05 * (dB - 384))`.

### Pink noise and calibration signals

While dedicated pink noise crates exist, **fundsp's** built-in generators provide the most practical solution for audio testing. Pink noise generation typically implements 1/f filtering on white noise using dasp or fundsp's filtering primitives, following established audio engineering algorithms.

## Real-time integration best practices

Successful spectrum analyzer implementation requires careful attention to real-time constraints and memory management.

### Memory allocation strategies

All FFT structures and buffers must be allocated in `Plugin::initialize()`, with the `assert_process_allocs` feature catching violations during development. Pre-allocate circular buffers, FFT scratch space, and window functions during initialization, then reuse throughout processing. The `reset()` function must remain allocation-free as it's called from the audio thread.

### GUI update patterns

Decimate spectrum updates to display refresh rate (typically 60Hz) rather than audio rate to prevent GUI thread saturation. Use atomic operations or lock-free structures for data transfer, with the audio thread writing and GUI thread reading asynchronously. Consider maintaining separate decimated spectrum buffers specifically for display to reduce data transfer overhead.
