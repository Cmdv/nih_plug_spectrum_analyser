# Spectrum Analyzer Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary
Based on comparison with FabFilter Pro-Q 4 and research from `math_techniques.md` and `rust-dsp-crates.md`, our spectrum analyzer needs several key improvements to match professional quality. The main issues are inadequate FFT resolution at low frequencies, missing temporal/frequency smoothing, lack of adaptive techniques, no tilt compensation, and choppy UI animation.

**Important**: The visual smoothness of Pro-Q 4 comes not just from DSP improvements but equally from sophisticated UI rendering techniques. Phase 3 (UI Rendering) is as crucial as the DSP phases for achieving professional appearance.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Low Frequency Resolution** (Critical)
- **Current**: Fixed 2048-point FFT giving 23.4Hz resolution at 48kHz
- **Problem**: At 186Hz, the broad peak shows poor frequency resolution
- **Pro-Q 4**: Uses 8192-16384 points for <500Hz (5.4Hz resolution)

### 2. **Missing Tilt Compensation** (High Priority)
- **Current**: No frequency tilt applied
- **Problem**: High frequencies appear diminished, less detail visible
- **Pro-Q 4**: 4.5 dB/octave tilt makes spectrum appear flatter

### 3. **Insufficient Smoothing** (High Priority)
- **Current**: Basic attack/release smoothing only
- **Problem**: Jagged, noisy appearance especially at high frequencies
- **Pro-Q 4**: Multiple smoothing layers (temporal + frequency-dependent)

### 4. **DC Offset and Low-Frequency Artifacts** (Medium Priority)
- **Current**: No DC removal
- **Problem**: DC bin affects nearby low-frequency bins
- **Pro-Q 4**: High-pass filtering removes DC content

### 5. **Fixed Window Function** (Medium Priority)
- **Current**: Hann window only
- **Problem**: Can't adapt to different analysis needs
- **Pro-Q 4**: Adaptive windowing based on signal characteristics

### 6. **Choppy UI Animation** (High Priority)
- **Current**: Direct display of FFT results, basic Bézier smoothing
- **Problem**: Jumpy animation, no frame-to-frame interpolation
- **Pro-Q 4**: Smooth 60+ FPS animation with interpolation

### 7. **Limited Display Modes** (Low Priority)
- **Current**: Line and fill only
- **Problem**: Can't switch visualization styles
- **Pro-Q 4**: Multiple modes (line, fill, bars, etc.)

## Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Static Pro-Q 4 Settings Implementation [BREAKPOINT 1]
**Goal**: Match Pro-Q 4's appearance using their exact default settings (hardcoded for now)

### Important Discovery:
Pro-Q 4 achieves clean spectrum at 186Hz using the same 2048-point FFT (Medium resolution) as our current implementation. The difference is in the post-processing settings!

### Pro-Q 4 Default Settings to Implement (Static):
```rust
// In spectrum_analyzer.rs - add these constants
const SPECTRUM_RANGE_DB: f32 = 90.0;           // Pro-Q 4 default
const SPECTRUM_RESOLUTION: usize = 2048;        // Medium (already have this)
const SPECTRUM_TILT_DB_PER_OCT: f32 = 4.5;     // Critical for natural look
const SPECTRUM_SPEED: SpectrumSpeed = SpectrumSpeed::Medium;

// Speed presets (from Pro-Q 4 behavior)
enum SpectrumSpeed {
    Slow,    // Attack: 0.05, Release: 0.01
    Medium,  // Attack: 0.15, Release: 0.02  
    Fast,    // Attack: 0.4, Release: 0.1
}
```

### Tasks:
1. **Apply 4.5 dB/oct tilt compensation**
   ```rust
   // In compute_magnitude_spectrum(), after calculating dB value:
   let tilted_db = apply_pink_noise_tilt(db_value, frequency);
   ```

2. **Add frequency-dependent smoothing**
   ```rust
   // Smooth high frequencies more to reduce jaggedness
   fn smooth_high_frequencies(spectrum: &mut [f32], sample_rate: f32) {
       let window_size = 2048;
       for i in 1..spectrum.len()-1 {
           let freq = (i as f32 * sample_rate) / window_size as f32;
           
           // Progressive smoothing above 1kHz
           if freq > 5000.0 {
               // 5-point weighted average for high frequencies
               let smooth = (spectrum[i] * 0.4 + 
                           spectrum[i-1] * 0.2 + 
                           spectrum[i+1] * 0.2 +
                           spectrum[i.saturating_sub(2)] * 0.1 +
                           spectrum[(i+2).min(spectrum.len()-1)] * 0.1);
               spectrum[i] = smooth;
           } else if freq > 1000.0 {
               // 3-point average for mid frequencies
               spectrum[i] = (spectrum[i] * 0.5 + 
                            spectrum[i-1] * 0.25 + 
                            spectrum[i+1] * 0.25);
           }
           // Leave low frequencies unchanged for sharpness
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Update smoothing constants for Medium speed** 
   ```rust
   // Exponential filtering formula: y[k] = α × x[k] + (1-α) × y[k-1]
   // Time constant relation: α = 1 - exp(-T/τ), where T=sample_period, τ=time_constant
   // Reference: https://gregstanleyandassociates.com/whitepapers/FaultDiagnosis/Filtering/Exponential-Filter/exponential-filter.htm
   
   const SPECTRUM_ATTACK_TIME_MS: f32 = 10.0;   // Fast attack (10ms)
   const SPECTRUM_RELEASE_TIME_MS: f32 = 100.0; // Slow release (100ms)
   
   fn calculate_smoothing_alpha(time_constant_ms: f32, sample_rate: f32) -> f32 {
       let tau = time_constant_ms / 1000.0; // Convert to seconds
       let sample_period = 1.0 / sample_rate;
       1.0 - (-sample_period / tau).exp()
   }
   ```

### Validation:
- High frequencies should be smooth like Pro-Q 4
- 4.5 dB/oct tilt should make pink noise appear flat
- 186Hz should remain sharp while high freqs are smoothed

## Phase 2: Adaptive Window Functions [BREAKPOINT 2]
**Goal**: Use optimal window functions for different frequency ranges

### Concept:
Different window functions excel at different frequency ranges. Pro-Q 4 likely uses adaptive windowing to optimize the trade-off between frequency resolution and spectral leakage.

### Window Selection Strategy (Based on Julius Smith's Analysis):
```rust
enum WindowType {
    Rectangular, // -13dB sidelobes, 6dB/oct rolloff, sharpest main lobe
    Hann,        // -31dB sidelobes, 18dB/oct rolloff, good balance
    Hamming,     // -41dB sidelobes, 6dB/oct rolloff, better suppression
    Kaiser(f32), // Parametric β: 0=rect, 5=hamming-like, 8.6=blackman-like
}

// Julius Smith's window selection criteria:
fn select_window_for_analysis_goal(signal_characteristics: SignalType) -> WindowType {
    match signal_characteristics {
        SignalType::PureTones => WindowType::Rectangular,      // Sharp peaks, minimal spreading
        SignalType::Harmonic => WindowType::Hann,              // Balanced, good for music
        SignalType::Noisy => WindowType::Hamming,              // Better sidelobe rejection
        SignalType::WideRange => WindowType::Kaiser(5.0),      // Adaptive compromise
    }
}
```

### Tasks:
1. **Implement multiple window generators** (Julius Smith formulas)
   ```rust
   // Hann: -31dB sidelobes, 18dB/octave rolloff (already implemented)
   fn generate_hann_window(size: usize) -> Vec<f32> {
       (0..size).map(|i| {
           let n = i as f32 / size as f32;
           0.5 * (1.0 + (2.0 * PI * n).cos())  // Julius Smith formula
       }).collect()
   }
   
   // Hamming: -41dB sidelobes, 6dB/octave rolloff (better than Hann for some cases)
   fn generate_hamming_window(size: usize) -> Vec<f32> {
       (0..size).map(|i| {
           let n = i as f32 / size as f32;
           0.54 - 0.46 * (2.0 * PI * n).cos()  // Julius Smith optimized coefficients
       }).collect()
   }
   
   // Kaiser: Parametric β control for optimal sidelobe/mainlobe tradeoff
   fn generate_kaiser_window(size: usize, beta: f32) -> Vec<f32> {
       // β = 0: Rectangular window
       // β = 5: Similar to Hamming (-40dB sidelobes)  
       // β = 8.6: Similar to Blackman (-60dB sidelobes)
       // Implementation requires modified Bessel function I₀(x)
   }
   ```

2. **Create frequency-aware analysis bands**
   ```rust
   // Analyze different frequency ranges with optimal windows
   struct MultiWindowAnalyzer {
       low_freq_fft: (WindowType::Blackman, 0-500Hz),
       mid_freq_fft: (WindowType::Hann, 500-5000Hz),
       high_freq_fft: (WindowType::Kaiser(3.0), 5000Hz+),
   }
   ```

3. **Blend results from different windows**
   ```rust
   // Crossfade between window results at boundaries
   fn blend_windowed_results(
       low_result: &[f32], 
       mid_result: &[f32], 
       high_result: &[f32]
   ) -> Vec<f32> {
       // Smooth transition between 450-550Hz and 4500-5500Hz
   }
   ```

### Validation:
- Bass frequencies should show less spectral leakage
- High frequencies should have sharper peaks
- Transitions between windows should be seamless

## Phase 3: Pink Noise Tilt Compensation [BREAKPOINT 3]
**Goal**: Reveal high-frequency detail like Pro-Q 4

### Tasks:
1. **Add tilt parameter to UI**
   - Range: 0 to 6 dB/octave
   - Default: 4.5 dB/octave (Pro-Q 4 standard)

2. **Apply frequency-dependent gain**
   ```rust
   fn apply_tilt_compensation(magnitude_db: f32, freq_hz: f32, tilt_db_per_oct: f32) -> f32 {
       let octaves_from_1khz = (freq_hz / 1000.0).log2();
       magnitude_db + (tilt_db_per_oct * octaves_from_1khz)
   }
   ```

3. **Update spectrum_display.rs**
   - Apply tilt after FFT magnitude calculation
   - Before smoothing to maintain accuracy

### Validation:
- Pink noise should appear flat with 3 dB/oct tilt
- High frequencies should show more detail in drum recordings

## Phase 3: UI Rendering and Animation [BREAKPOINT 3]
**Goal**: Smooth, professional spectrum animation like Pro-Q 4

### Tasks:
1. **Implement frame-to-frame interpolation**
   ```rust
   // In spectrum_display.rs
   struct AnimatedSpectrum {
       current_display: Vec<f32>,
       target_spectrum: Vec<f32>,
       animation_speed: f32, // 0.1 = slow, 0.9 = fast
   }
   
   fn animate_spectrum(&mut self, dt: f32) {
       for i in 0..self.current_display.len() {
           let diff = self.target_spectrum[i] - self.current_display[i];
           self.current_display[i] += diff * self.animation_speed * dt;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add adaptive point density**
   ```rust
   fn calculate_display_points(zoom_level: f32) -> usize {
       match zoom_level {
           z if z > 2.0 => 1536,  // High detail when zoomed
           z if z > 1.0 => 768,   // Current default
           _ => 384,              // Lower detail for full view
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Implement multiple display modes**
   - **Line mode**: Current implementation
   - **Filled mode**: Current with transparency
   - **Bar mode**: Vertical bars like vintage analyzers
   - **Dots mode**: Individual peak points
   ```rust
   enum DisplayMode {
       Line,
       FilledArea { opacity: f32 },
       Bars { width: f32, gap: f32 },
       Dots { size: f32 },
   }
   ```

4. **Add peak hold visualization**
   ```rust
   struct PeakHold {
       peaks: Vec<f32>,
       hold_time: Vec<f32>, // Time each peak has been held
       decay_rate: f32,     // How fast peaks fall after hold
   }
   ```

5. **Improve curve smoothing**
   - Use Catmull-Rom splines for smoother curves
   - Adaptive smoothing based on frequency (more at low freq)
   - Anti-aliasing for sub-pixel accuracy

6. **GPU acceleration optimizations**
   - Cache static geometry (grid, labels)
   - Use vertex buffers for spectrum curve
   - Batch draw calls
   - Consider using wgpu for complex scenes

### Validation:
- Spectrum should animate smoothly at 60 FPS
- No visible stepping or jitter in animation
- Peak holds should be clearly visible
- Different modes should render correctly

## Phase 4: Advanced Smoothing System [BREAKPOINT 4]
**Goal**: Clean, professional appearance without losing important detail

### Tasks:
1. **Implement temporal smoothing with variable speed**
   ```rust
   // Based on math_techniques.md line 33
   fn temporal_smooth(current: f32, previous: f32, speed: Speed) -> f32 {
       let (attack_ms, release_ms) = match speed {
           Speed::Slow => (50.0, 500.0),
           Speed::Medium => (10.0, 200.0),
           Speed::Fast => (1.0, 50.0),
       };
       // Convert to alpha coefficients...
   }
   ```

2. **Add frequency-dependent smoothing**
   ```rust
   // Based on math_techniques.md line 31
   fn octave_smooth(spectrum: &[f32], octave_fraction: f32) -> Vec<f32> {
       // Gaussian smoothing with increasing bandwidth at higher frequencies
       // σ = (f_center / N_octave) / π
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Video Bandwidth (VBW) filtering**
   - Post-processing smoothing that doesn't affect resolution
   - Reduces visual noise while preserving peaks

### Validation:
- High frequencies should appear smooth, not jagged
- Transients should still be visible with appropriate attack time

## Phase 5: DC Offset Removal [BREAKPOINT 5]
**Goal**: Eliminate low-frequency artifacts

### Tasks:
1. **Implement high-pass filter**
   ```rust
   // Based on math_techniques.md line 39
   struct DcBlocker {
       alpha: f32,  // 0.95 to 0.999
       previous_input: f32,
       previous_output: f32,
   }
   ```

2. **Apply before windowing**
   - Calculate frame average
   - Subtract from all samples
   - Then apply window function

3. **Handle DC bin specially**
   - Set DC bin to minimum after FFT
   - Or apply steep high-pass below 20Hz

### Validation:
- DC offset in input shouldn't affect spectrum
- Low frequencies should be cleaner, less "muddy"

## Phase 6: Professional Features [BREAKPOINT 6]
**Goal**: Match Pro-Q 4's advanced capabilities

### Tasks:
1. **Add resolution modes**
   - Low: 1024-2048 FFT (fast, less detail)
   - Medium: 2048-4096 FFT (balanced)
   - High: 4096-16384 FFT (maximum detail)

2. **Implement peak hold/freeze**
   - Store maximum values over time
   - Display as separate line/dots
   - Clear on demand

3. **Add precise frequency interpolation** (Multiple methods available)
   ```rust
   /// Quadratic (parabolic) peak interpolation for sub-bin accuracy
   /// 
   /// References: 
   /// - "Spectral Audio Signal Processing" by Julius O. Smith III
   /// - https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Quadratic_Interpolation_Spectral_Peaks.html
   /// 
   /// This method achieves errors < 0.01% of semitone for pure tones
   /// Works best in dB magnitude domain where peaks are parabolic
   fn quadratic_peak_interpolation(alpha: f32, beta: f32, gamma: f32) -> (f32, f32) {
       // Where alpha, beta, gamma are dB magnitudes at bins k-1, k, k+1
       
       // Peak location (constrained to [-0.5, 0.5] bins)
       // Formula: p = 0.5 * (α - γ) / (α - 2β + γ)
       let p = 0.5 * (alpha - gamma) / (alpha - 2.0 * beta + gamma);
       let p_clamped = p.clamp(-0.5, 0.5);
       
       // Peak magnitude correction: y(p) = β - 0.25(α - γ)p
       let magnitude = beta - 0.25 * (alpha - gamma) * p_clamped;
       
       (p_clamped, magnitude)
   }
   
   /// Windowed sinc interpolation (higher accuracy, more computationally expensive)
   /// Reference: https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/12580/obtain-a-signals-peak-value-if-its-frequency-lies-between-two-bin-centers
   fn sinc_interpolation_peak(spectrum: &[f32], peak_bin: usize, radius: usize) -> (f32, f32) {
       // Uses multiple neighboring bins for very accurate estimation
       // Recommended for high-precision applications
       // Implementation would use sinc kernel convolution
       unimplemented!("Advanced technique - implement if parabolic insufficient")
   }
   
   /// Convert fractional bin to actual frequency
   /// Final frequency estimate: (k* + p) * fs / N
   fn interpolated_frequency(bin_k: usize, p: f32, sample_rate: f32, fft_size: usize) -> f32 {
       (bin_k as f32 + p) * (sample_rate / fft_size as f32)
   }
   
   /// Apply interpolation to enhance peak accuracy across spectrum
   fn enhance_peak_accuracy(spectrum: &mut [f32], sample_rate: f32) {
       for i in 1..spectrum.len()-1 {
           // Find local maxima (peaks)
           if spectrum[i] > spectrum[i-1] && spectrum[i] > spectrum[i+1] {
               let (p, enhanced_mag) = quadratic_peak_interpolation(
                   spectrum[i-1], spectrum[i], spectrum[i+1]
               );
               spectrum[i] = enhanced_mag; // Enhanced peak magnitude
               // True frequency available as: interpolated_frequency(i, p, sample_rate, 2048)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Perceptual weighting options**
   - A-weighting (already implemented)
   - K-weighting for broadcast
   - Flat response

### Validation:
- Peak detection should be more accurate
- Different modes should clearly affect display

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization [BREAKPOINT 7]
**Goal**: Maintain 60+ FPS with all features enabled

### Tasks:

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Documentation Requirements
**CRITICAL**: This is a learning project. All functions must include comprehensive comments explaining:
- What the function does and why it's needed
- Mathematical concepts being implemented
- Parameter meanings and expected ranges  
- Return value interpretation
- Any trade-offs or implementation decisions

Example commenting style:
```rust
/// Applies Hann windowing to reduce spectral leakage in FFT analysis
/// 
/// The Hann window tapers signal edges to zero, reducing discontinuities that
/// cause spectral leakage (energy spreading across frequency bins). This improves
/// frequency resolution at the cost of slightly widening spectral peaks.
/// 
/// # Parameters
/// * `samples` - Time domain audio samples to be windowed
/// * `window_coeffs` - Pre-computed Hann coefficients [0.0..1.0]
/// 
/// # Returns
/// Vector of windowed samples, same length as input
/// 
/// # Mathematical Background
/// Hann formula: w[n] = 0.5 * (1 - cos(2πn/N))
/// Provides -31dB sidelobe suppression with 4-bin main lobe width
/// 
/// # References
/// - "Spectral Audio Signal Processing" by Julius O. Smith III, Chapter 3
/// - https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/parshl/Analysis_Window_Step_1.html
/// - Window Function Theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function
fn apply_hann_window(samples: &[f32], window_coeffs: &[f32]) -> Vec<f32>
```

Comments should focus on:
- **Educational value** - explain concepts for learning
- **Current implementation** - describe what this code does  
- **Mathematical background** - why this approach works
- **Practical implications** - trade-offs and behavior

**DO NOT** reference external tools, comparisons, or "fixing" anything. Document what the code does, not what it's trying to match.

## Development Notes

- Start with Phase 1 as it addresses core functionality
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Breakpoints allow validation before proceeding
- Keep existing code as fallback during development
- Prioritize learning and understanding over speed
